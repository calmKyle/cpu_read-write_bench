# Little CPU read & write Benchmark

This is a small benchmark because I'm observing significant differences while running my TYP on two different CPUs (Intel and AMD) with the same number of cores and threads.


## How to run

Windows: 

    ./run.bat

Linux:

    sh run.sh

I hope you all find this enjoyable!
